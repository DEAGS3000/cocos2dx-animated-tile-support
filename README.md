# cocos2dx-animated-tile-support
A new `TMXTiledmapEx` class that supports animated tile of TMX tiledmap in layer-level. Animated tiles are still rendered with `SpriteBatchNode`.

## How To Use

Add `TMXPropertyAnimation` into the seconed enum of CCTMXXMLParser.h

Then just copy everything into your project and use `TMXTiledmapEx` in the same way like cocos2d::TMXTiledmap.
